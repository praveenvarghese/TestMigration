	// Using textOrKeys.split("") will break on characters in the astral plane like emojis because
	// in Javascript internal string representation is 16-bit (2 bytes); however emojis requires
	// three bytes. Therefore, javascript uses surrogate pairs to represent those symbols in two
	// chars. For example, if you do 'ðŸ˜€'.length you will get two instead of one. In ES6 things got
	// better, for example doing [...myString].length will get you the correct length. However, even
	// this trick will fail when using grapheme cluster such as 'à®¨à®¿'. To correctly split a string you
	// need to implement the Unicode Text Segmentation:
	// https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Grapheme_Cluster_Boundaries
	// Luckily, Javascript now has Intl.Segmenter API to do exactly that:
	// [...(new Intl.Segmenter).segment(s)].map(x => x.segment)
	// However, Intl.Segmenter https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-segmenter landed in Chrome 87
	// (v8 8.7); therefore only available in Node 16+
